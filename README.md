CS 4310 Project 1 - Multithreaded sorting, CPU scheduling simulator

## Task #1 â€“ Multithreaded Sorting Application
Simply compile and run the Main.java file. No further interaction required.

## Task #2 - CPU Scheduling Simulator
The program will prompt the user for an input file. The file should be formatted as follows:

` pid arrival_time burst_time priority `

where each field is an integer value. After reading the input file, the program will prompt for which scheduling algorithm will run. Afterwards, a readout of the algorithm will be displayed.
